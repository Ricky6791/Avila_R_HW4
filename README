Structure of Program:
File organization: Water.cpp
Functional organization: 3 classes with inheritance: Grid, Watervehicle, Submarine. Operator overload = for two submarines.

Status: Mostly complete couldn't figure out how to tie shots fired to the submarine and its location. Surfaced acts strange on csegrid but works correctly on my machine

Hardware & platform I used: Intel core i7 with 16GB RAM MacOS

Compile: extract the archive and then from shell run "make". This will create executable hw2 and then run ./hw4
